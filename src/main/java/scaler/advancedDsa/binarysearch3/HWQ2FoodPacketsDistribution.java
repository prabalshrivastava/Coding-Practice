public class HWQ2FoodPacketsDistribution {
    //    Problem Description
//    The government wants to set up B distribution offices across N cities for the distribution of food
//    packets. The population of the ith city is A[i]. Each city must have at least 1 office, and people can go to an office of their own city. We want to maximize the minimum number of people who can get food in any single office.
//            Problem Constraints
//1 <= N <= 105
//            1 <= A[i] <= 106
//            1 <= B <= 5 x 105
//    Input Format
//    The first line of input contains an integer array A.
//    The second line of input contains an integer B.
//            Output Format
//    Return one integer representing the maximum number of people who can get food in any single office.
//            Example Input
//    Input 1:
//    A = [10000, 20000, 30000]
//    B = 6
//    Input 2:
//    A = [1, 1, 1]
//    B = 4
//    Example Output
//    Output 1:
//            10000
//    Output 2:
//            0
//    Example Explanation
//    Explanation 1:
//            1 office can be opened in the first city,
//  2 offices in the second city and
//  3 in the third. This way ,
//  10,000 people can get food in the office in the first city, and
//  10,000 people can get food in each office in the second city and
//  10,000 people can get food in third city.
//    We will allot 10000 people in each office in the third city.
//    Had we alloted more in some office, we had to allot lesser in some other office which will reduce the answer.
//    Explanation 2:
//    We will have to allot 2 offices to one city. And one of these offices would give food to 0 people.
